## 📁 Introduction

The notebook file `Decision_Tree_Bank.ipynb` is a project to analyze and build a machine learning model using **Decision Tree Classifier** on a bank marketing dataset (Bank Marketing Dataset). The data is taken from a telemarketing campaign of a Portuguese bank to promote a term deposit product.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Data preprocessing: handle missing data, categorical encoding, and normalize data.

- Data exploration: use histograms and descriptive statistics to better understand the distribution and relationships between attributes.

- Build a Decision Tree model to classify customers who are likely to register for a term deposit or not.

- Evaluate the model using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score and Confusion Matrix.

## 🧠 Main content

- Load data and process input data
- Analyze data using visualization (histogram, countplot, ...)
- Encode categorical data using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding
- Split training and testing sets (train/test split)
- Train the Decision Tree model
- Display and evaluate the model

## ✅ Conclusion

- The decision tree model is an easy-to-understand and intuitive method, suitable for analyzing factors affecting customer decisions.

- After training, the model achieves reasonable accuracy and allows the recognition of the most important attributes such as "contact", "duration", "month", etc.
- The model can be improved by using pruning techniques, hyperparameter tuning, or testing other models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

## 📂 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
